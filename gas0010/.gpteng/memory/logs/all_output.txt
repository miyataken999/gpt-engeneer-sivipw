================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

I assume you want me to create a Python project with a specific architecture. Since you didn't provide any specific requirements, I'll create a simple project with a few classes and functions.

Here is the project structure:

```
project/
requirements.txt
src/
__init__.py
main.py
models/
__init__.py
user.py
services/
__init__.py
user_service.py
repositories/
__init__.py
user_repository.py
utils/
__init__.py
string_utils.py
tests/
test_main.py
test_user_service.py
```

Here is the code for each file:

requirements.txt
```
pytest
dataclasses
```

src/__init__.py
```
# empty file
```

src/main.py
```
from src.services.user_service import UserService

def main():
    user_service = UserService()
    user_service.greet("John")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

src/models/__init__.py
```
# empty file
```

src/models/user.py
```
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class User:
    """Represents a user."""
    name: str
```

src/services/__init__.py
```
# empty file
```

src/services/user_service.py
```
from src.repositories.user_repository import UserRepository
from src.models.user import User

class UserService:
    """Provides user-related services."""
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_repository = UserRepository()

    def greet(self, name: str):
        """Greets a user."""
        user = User(name)
        self.user_repository.save(user)
        print(f"Hello, {user.name}!")
```

src/repositories/__init__.py
```
# empty file
```

src/repositories/user_repository.py
```
class UserRepository:
    """Provides access to user data."""
    def save(self, user: 'User'):
        """Saves a user."""
        print(f"Saving user: {user.name}")
```

src/utils/__init__.py
```
# empty file
```

src/utils/string_utils.py
```
def capitalize(s: str) -> str:
    """Capitalizes a string."""
    return s.capitalize()
```

tests/test_main.py
```
from src.main import main

def test_main():
    main()
```

tests/test_user_service.py
```
from src.services.user_service import UserService

def test_greet():
    user_service = UserService()
    user_service.greet("John")
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.

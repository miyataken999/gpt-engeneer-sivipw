================================ System Message ================================

You will get instructions for code to write.
You will write a very long answer. Make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code.
Think step by step and reason yourself to the correct decisions to make sure we get it right.
First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose.

You will output the content of each file necessary to achieve the goal, including ALL code.
Represent files like so:

FILENAME
```
CODE
```

The following tokens must be replaced like so:
FILENAME is the lowercase combined path and file name including the file extension
CODE is the code in the file

Example representation of a file:

src/hello_world.py
```
print("Hello World")
```

Do not comment on what every file does. Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.


You will start with the "entrypoint" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.
Please note that the code should be fully functional. No placeholders.

Follow a language and framework appropriate best practice file naming convention.
Make sure that files contain all imports, types etc.  The code should be fully functional. Make sure that code in different files are compatible with each other.
Ensure to implement all code, if you are unsure, write a plausible implementation.
Include module dependency or package manager dependency definition file.
Before you finish, double check that all parts of the architecture is present in the files.

When you are done, write finish with "this concludes a fully working implementation".

Useful to know:
Almost always put different classes in different files.
Always use the programming language the user asks for.
For Python, you always create an appropriate requirements.txt file.
For NodeJS, you always create an appropriate package.json file.
Always add a comment briefly describing the purpose of the function definition.
Add comments explaining very complex bits of logic.
Always follow the best practices for the requested languages for folder/file structure and how to package the project.

I understand that you want me to create a fully functional implementation of a Python project. Since you didn't specify a particular problem or domain, I'll create a simple project that demonstrates a basic architecture.

Let's create a simple banking system that allows users to create accounts, deposit, withdraw, and check their balances.

Here's the project structure:

```
banking_system
requirements.txt
src
__init__.py
account.py
bank.py
main.py
tests
__init__.py
test_account.py
test_bank.py
```

Here are the contents of each file:

**requirements.txt**
```
pytest
dataclasses
```

**src/__init__.py**
```
# empty file
```

**src/account.py**
```
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Account:
    """Represents a bank account"""
    account_number: int
    balance: float = 0.0

    def deposit(self, amount: float) -> None:
        """Deposit money into the account"""
        self.balance += amount

    def withdraw(self, amount: float) -> None:
        """Withdraw money from the account"""
        if amount > self.balance:
            raise ValueError("Insufficient balance")
        self.balance -= amount

    def get_balance(self) -> float:
        """Get the current balance of the account"""
        return self.balance
```

**src/bank.py**
```
from .account import Account

class Bank:
    """Represents a bank"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.accounts = {}

    def create_account(self, account_number: int) -> Account:
        """Create a new account"""
        if account_number in self.accounts:
            raise ValueError("Account already exists")
        account = Account(account_number)
        self.accounts[account_number] = account
        return account

    def get_account(self, account_number: int) -> Account:
        """Get an existing account"""
        return self.accounts.get(account_number)

    def list_accounts(self) -> list:
        """Get a list of all accounts"""
        return list(self.accounts.values())
```

**src/main.py**
```
from .bank import Bank

def main():
    bank = Bank()
    account = bank.create_account(1234)
    account.deposit(100.0)
    print(account.get_balance())  # 100.0
    account.withdraw(50.0)
    print(account.get_balance())  # 50.0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**tests/__init__.py**
```
# empty file
```

**tests/test_account.py**
```
import pytest
from src.account import Account

def test_account_creation():
    account = Account(1234)
    assert account.balance == 0.0

def test_deposit():
    account = Account(1234)
    account.deposit(100.0)
    assert account.balance == 100.0

def test_withdraw():
    account = Account(1234)
    account.deposit(100.0)
    account.withdraw(50.0)
    assert account.balance == 50.0
```

**tests/test_bank.py**
```
import pytest
from src.bank import Bank

def test_create_account():
    bank = Bank()
    account = bank.create_account(1234)
    assert account.account_number == 1234

def test_get_account():
    bank = Bank()
    account = bank.create_account(1234)
    retrieved_account = bank.get_account(1234)
    assert retrieved_account == account

def test_list_accounts():
    bank = Bank()
    bank.create_account(1234)
    bank.create_account(5678)
    accounts = bank.list_accounts()
    assert len(accounts) == 2
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
